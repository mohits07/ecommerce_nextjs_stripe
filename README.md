This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

If any error occurs, you can run/build the dependencies first:
npm installed

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The api's are used to fetch Shoes data from Sanity data management tool.

Api's can fetch all/custom shoes, fetch varities of certain shoes, maintain cart items and handle payments through Stripe API.

You must create a .env file in the root folder to setup the Sanity backend and also provide the keys for Stripe payment. Without Sanity connection, the products will not be displayed on page.
